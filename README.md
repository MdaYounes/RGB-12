# RGB-12

Just a small ios app that is mainly aimed at being a learning project. ***RGB-12*** is a simple memory game where you 
are rapidly shown either the color red, green or blue 12 times in a row. After this, you have to recall the order of the
colors that were shown. No colors can appear more than once in a row.

**Main Probleamtic:** How to host my own app to completely nullifying the use of Firebase and other serverless 
solutions?
