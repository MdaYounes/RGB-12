# Requirements

## The App Itself

This is obvious but should be said as this is a list of ALL requirements. The app itself shouldn't take more than a
couple of hours to make.

## Compuer

This is obvious aswell, and I will use my MBP 15 2015 16GB RAM and i7.

## Client
    
An iPhone in that case.

## Networking/Marshalling

A way to communicate between the server and the iPhone.
